## ✅ Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔍 Objective
To explore and understand the structure of the student performance dataset and identify meaningful insights using descriptive statistics and visual tools.

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

### 📌 Key Analyses
- Data cleaning (nulls, duplicates)  
- Distribution of subject scores  
- Comparison by gender, parental education, and lunch type  
- Correlation between math, reading, and writing scores  

### 📊 Insights
- Students with **standard lunch** and **completed test preparation** score higher.  
- **Female students** perform better in reading and writing.  
- Reading and writing scores are **strongly positively correlated**.
